            <p>
                Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is a space where I'll be sharing thoughts, 
                experiments, and reflections on technology, creativity, and whatever else captures my 
                attention. I've been thinking about starting a blog for a while now, and finally decided 
                to just build it and see where it goes.
            </p>

                <div class="image-caption">Where most of my writing happens</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                There's something about the permanence of the web that feels both exciting and terrifying. 
                Unlike social media posts that get buried in feeds, a blog post sits there, waiting to be 
                discovered. It's a different kind of publishing—more intentional, more thoughtful.
            </p>

            <div class="pull-quote">
                "A blog is a conversation with yourself that anyone can listen in on."
            </div>

            <h2>Why Now?</h2>

            <p>
                I've been collecting notes, screenshots, and half-formed ideas for years. They sit in 
                scattered folders and apps, never quite making it out into the world. Starting this blog 
                is an attempt to change that—to give these thoughts a place to live and breathe.
            </p>

            <p>
                The web feels different now than it did a few years ago. More crowded, but somehow also 
                more fragmented. Personal websites and blogs feel like a return to something more human, 
                less algorithmic. A place where you can build something that's truly yours.
            </p>

            <div class="article-divider">* * *</div>

            <h2>What to Expect</h2>

            <p>
                I'm not entirely sure what this blog will become. Maybe it'll be mostly technical writing. 
                Maybe it'll be more personal. Probably it'll be both. The only rule I'm setting for myself 
                is to write when I have something to say, not according to some arbitrary schedule.
            </p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                "The best blogs are the ones where the author is thinking out loud, working through ideas 
                in real-time. You can feel them discovering things as they write."
                <div class="blockquote-author">— Someone on the Internet</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Some posts will be polished essays. Others might just be links and commentary. Some will 
                include code, screenshots, or diagrams. I want this to be a flexible space that can adapt 
                to whatever form the idea needs to take.
            </p>

            <h3>Topics I'm Interested In</h3>

            <p>
                Right now, I'm thinking a lot about web design, creative coding, and how we build tools 
                for thinking. I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity—how 
                constraints can unlock new possibilities, how the medium shapes the message.
            </p>

                <div class="image-caption">Building for the web never gets old</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                I'm also interested in the more philosophical questions: What makes a good website? 
                What's worth building? How do we create things that are both useful and beautiful? 
                These are questions I'll probably be exploring here.
            </p>

            <h2>A Space to Think</h2>

            <p>
                More than anything, I want this blog to be a space for thinking. Not just sharing 
                finished thoughts, but working through ideas, making connections, changing my mind. 
                Writing forces you to clarify your thinking in ways that just keeping notes never does.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're reading this, thanks for being here. Feel free to reach out if something 
                resonates with you. The best part of putting things on the internet is the unexpected 
                conversations that follow.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's see where this goes.
